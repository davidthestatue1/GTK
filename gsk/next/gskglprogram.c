/**
 * gsk_gl_program_add_uniform:
 * @self: a #GskGLProgram
 * @name: the name of the uniform such as "u_source"
 * @key: the identifier to use for the uniform
 *
 * This method will create a mapping between @key and the location
 * of the uniform on the GPU. This simplifies calling code to not
 * need to know where the uniform location is and only register it
 * when creating the program.
 *
 * You might use this with an enum of all your uniforms for the
 * program and then register each of them like:
 *
 * ```
 * gsk_gl_program_add_uniform (program, "u_source", UNIFORM_SOURCE);
 * ```
 *
 * That allows you to set values for the program with something
 * like the following:
 *
 * ```
 * gsk_gl_program_set_uniform1i (program, UNIFORM_SOURCE, 1);
 * ```
 *
 * Returns: %TRUE if the uniform was found; otherwise %FALSE
